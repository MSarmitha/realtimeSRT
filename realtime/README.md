Realtime speechrecognition system for customer support automation:



** Overview**
This system enables real-time voice interaction with customers using speech recognition and text-to-speech (TTS) for a basic customer support scenario. It listens to the user's voice, processes it into text, determines an automated response based on the query, and speaks back the response.

** Technologies Used**
Python – Primary programming language.

speech_recognition – Converts spoken language into text using Google’s Speech Recognition API.

pyttsx3 – Converts text responses into speech for audible feedback.

Microphone Input – For real-time interaction using a mic.

**Dependencies**
You need the following Python libraries:

bash-pip install speechrecognition
Copy
Edit
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
SpeechRecognition – Core speech recognition library.

pyttsx3 – Offline text-to-speech conversion.

pyaudio – Captures microphone input (used by speech_recognition).

**How It Works (Procedure)**
Initialize Modules

speech_recognition.Recognizer() listens to speech.

pyttsx3.init() prepares the text-to-speech engine.

**Define Logic**

A function automated_response() maps certain keywords (like "account", "support") to predefined responses.

Start Listening Loop

with sr.Microphone() activates the mic.

adjust_for_ambient_noise() calibrates mic to environment noise.

recognizer.listen() captures audio input.

Speech Recognition

recognize_google() converts spoken input to text using Google's API.

Response Handling

Based on the recognized text, it generates a suitable response using keyword checks.

Text-to-Speech

engine.say() and engine.runAndWait() speak the response.

**Error Handling**

UnknownValueError for unrecognized speech.

RequestError for network/API issues.

**Use Case / Usage**
-Ideal for IVR replacements, chatbot enhancements, or self-service kiosks.

-Enhances customer experience by offering hands-free support.

-Can be extended to connect with CRMs, databases, or APIs for dynamic query handling.
