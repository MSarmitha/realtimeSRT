# üéß Real-Time Speech Recognition System for Customer Support Automation

## ‚úÖ Overview

This project implements a real-time voice-based customer service system using speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies. It allows users to speak their queries, automatically identifies key topics (e.g., account, support, payment), and provides instant spoken responses. This kind of automation helps reduce the workload of human support agents and enhances customer experience with 24/7 interaction.
